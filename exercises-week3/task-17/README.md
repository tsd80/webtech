Create a class Marker that is an abstraction of marker object. Marker can be manipulated with methods putCapOn(), takeCapOff(), and draw(). The draw() method works only if 1) the marker cap is open, and 2) marker has at least 1 unit of ink. draw() returns true if drawing was successful (and 1 unit of ink was consumed), false otherwise. Write code or UI to test that a marker object behaves appropriately. Hint: you might want to use variables to 1) store the state of the cap (on or off), and 2) the amount of ink in the marker.
