Create a CoffeeMaker class that allows user to see if the appliance is switched on by calling isOn(), pressOnOffSwitch(), fillBeansContainer(), fillWaterContainer(), and brew() coffee. Brewing can only be successfully done if the appliance is on, and has enough beans as well as enough water. Divide your CoffeeMaker implementation to multiple classes. For example, you might consider implementing WaterContainerand BeansContainerseparately (and they might have some common Container functionality)
